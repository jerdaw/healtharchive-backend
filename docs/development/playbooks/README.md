# Development playbooks (task-oriented)

These playbooks describe common developer workflows without duplicating deeper docs.

- Local environment setup: `../dev-environment-setup.md`
- Local end-to-end testing flows: `../live-testing.md`
- Change → production workflow (solo-fast): `change-to-production.md`
- Making database changes (migrations): `database-migrations.md`
- Adding new CLI commands: `add-cli-command.md`
