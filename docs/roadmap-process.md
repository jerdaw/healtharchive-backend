# Roadmap process (pointer)

This repo separates:

- the **backlog** (what is not implemented),
- **active implementation plans** (what we are currently doing),
- and **canonical docs** (what exists and how to run/operate it),

to reduce documentation drift.

Canonical guidance:

- Roadmap workflow: `documentation-guidelines.md`
- Roadmaps index: `planning/README.md`
- Backlog: `planning/roadmap.md`
- Implemented plans archive: `planning/implemented/README.md`
