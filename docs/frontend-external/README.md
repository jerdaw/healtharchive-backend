# Frontend documentation

The HealthArchive frontend lives in the separate repository:

- https://github.com/jerdaw/healtharchive-frontend

This backend repo’s documentation site includes a minimal “Frontend” section that
links out to the canonical docs (we intentionally do not mirror frontend docs
into this site).

For the canonical, up-to-date frontend docs, see:

- Frontend overview: https://github.com/jerdaw/healtharchive-frontend/blob/main/docs/README.md
- I18n: https://github.com/jerdaw/healtharchive-frontend/blob/main/docs/i18n.md
- Implementation guide: https://github.com/jerdaw/healtharchive-frontend/blob/main/docs/implementation-guide.md
