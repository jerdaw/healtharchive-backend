# Phase 4 Partner Kit (internal ops guide)

Purpose: A lightweight, partner-ready kit that makes it easy to link to
HealthArchive without implying endorsement or medical guidance.

Do not include private emails or contact lists here.

Canonical public assets (do not duplicate copy here):

- One-page brief (source file): `healtharchive-frontend/public/partner-kit/healtharchive-brief.md`
- Citation handout (source file): `healtharchive-frontend/public/partner-kit/healtharchive-citation.md`
- Live pages: `https://www.healtharchive.ca/brief` and `https://www.healtharchive.ca/cite`

If you need to update public copy, edit the frontend assets above and deploy the frontend.

## 1) Distribution blurb (pasteable)

HealthArchive.ca is an independent, non-governmental archive of Canadian
public health web pages. It provides time-stamped snapshots and descriptive
change tracking so researchers, journalists, and educators can audit how
guidance evolves over time. It is not current guidance or medical advice.

Suggested links:

- Digest (RSS + overview): https://www.healtharchive.ca/digest
- Changes feed: https://www.healtharchive.ca/changes
- One-page brief: https://www.healtharchive.ca/brief
- Citation guidance: https://www.healtharchive.ca/cite
- Methods and scope: https://www.healtharchive.ca/methods
