## Template A: Distribution partner (library/resources page)

Subject: HealthArchive.ca (archive + change tracking) for your resources page

Hello <Name>,

I maintain HealthArchive.ca, an independent archive of Canadian public health
web pages. It preserves time-stamped snapshots and provides descriptive change
tracking so researchers and educators can cite what guidance said at a specific
time.

It is not medical advice or current guidance; it is a provenance archive.

Would you consider adding HealthArchive.ca to your digital scholarship or
public health methods resources page? The easiest option is to link to our
changes feed or digest:

- https://www.healtharchive.ca/changes
- https://www.healtharchive.ca/digest

If helpful, I can send a short one-page brief and screenshots.

Thank you for considering it,
<Your name>

## Template B: Research/teaching partner

Subject: Resource for reproducibility of public health guidance (HealthArchive.ca)

Hello <Name>,

I run HealthArchive.ca, an independent archive of Canadian public health web
pages with time-stamped snapshots and descriptive change tracking.

This can support reproducibility work and teaching about how guidance evolves
over time (without interpreting or endorsing content).

Would it be useful for your group to include HealthArchive in a methods
reading list, teaching module, or research workflow? I can share a one-page
brief and suggested citation format.

Thanks for your time,
<Your name>

## Template C: Journalism / communication partner

Subject: Archive of Canadian public health guidance (time-stamped snapshots)

Hello <Name>,

HealthArchive.ca is an independent archive of Canadian public health web pages.
It preserves time-stamped snapshots and provides a changes feed so journalists
can audit how wording evolves over time. It is not current guidance or medical
advice.

If this could be useful to your work, the digest and changes feed are here:

- https://www.healtharchive.ca/changes
- https://www.healtharchive.ca/digest

I can share a brief overview and citation guidance if helpful.

Best,
<Your name>

## Follow-up (1 week)

Subject: Re: HealthArchive.ca resource link

Hello <Name>,

Just following up in case my note got buried. HealthArchive.ca is an archive of
Canadian public health guidance with time-stamped snapshots and descriptive
change tracking. It is not current guidance or medical advice.

If it is useful, the quickest addition is a link to:

- https://www.healtharchive.ca/digest

Thanks again for considering it.

## Follow-up (2 weeks, final)

Subject: Closing the loop on HealthArchive.ca

Hello <Name>,

I will close the loop for now, but if HealthArchive.ca becomes useful in the
future, I am happy to provide a short brief or citation guidance.

Thank you,
<Your name>

## Optional: Onboarding blurb (for partners to paste)

HealthArchive.ca is an independent, non-governmental archive of Canadian public
health web pages. It preserves time-stamped snapshots and provides descriptive
change tracking for reproducibility and auditability. It is not current guidance
or medical advice. Always consult official sources for up-to-date guidance.
