# Phase 4 Verification Packet (draft outline)

Purpose: A short, shareable summary for a verifier (librarian, researcher,
or editor) to review and potentially confirm your role and the project's value.

Do NOT include private emails or personal data. Keep it factual.

---

## 1) Project overview (one paragraph)

HealthArchive.ca is an independent, non-governmental archive of Canadian public
health web pages. It preserves time-stamped snapshots and provides descriptive
change tracking so researchers, journalists, and educators can audit how
guidance evolves over time. It is not current guidance or medical advice.

## 2) What is live now (key links)

- Home: https://www.healtharchive.ca/
- Archive search: https://www.healtharchive.ca/archive
- Snapshot viewer: https://www.healtharchive.ca/snapshot/<id>
- Changes feed (edition-aware): https://www.healtharchive.ca/changes
- Compare view: https://www.healtharchive.ca/compare?to=<id>

- Methods & scope: https://www.healtharchive.ca/methods
- Governance: https://www.healtharchive.ca/governance
- Status/impact: https://www.healtharchive.ca/status and /impact

## 3) What I built / operate (short bullets)

- Archive capture pipeline (annual editions, scope rules).
- Snapshot indexing and search.
- Public changes feed and compare views (descriptive diffs).
- Governance, takedown, and issue-reporting process.
- Ongoing operations (monitoring, backups, scheduled change tracking).

## 4) Current metrics (fill from /status)

- Sources tracked: [N]
- Snapshots: [N]
- Pages: [N]

## 5) What verification would mean (sample wording)

"I can verify that <Name> built and operates HealthArchive.ca, and that the
project is used as a resource for reproducibility / auditability of Canadian
public health guidance. I understand it is an archival tool, not medical
advice."

## 6) Permission request (explicit)

- Are you willing to verify my role and the project's utility?
- May I list your name and title publicly as a verifier?
- Preferred wording (if any)?

## 7) Notes for the verifier

- The site is explicitly non-authoritative and not affiliated with any public
  health agency.
- Change tracking is descriptive only; it does not interpret meaning.
