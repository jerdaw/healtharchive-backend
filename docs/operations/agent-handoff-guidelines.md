# Agent Handoff Guidelines (internal)

This repo contains internal operations documentation. Keep everything **public-safe**:

- Do not include secrets, tokens, private emails, internal IPs, or private names.
- Prefer stable identifiers over prose (timer names, release tags, file paths, commit SHAs).
- When recording “firsts”, treat them as historical facts and include stable IDs (e.g., release tag, log filename).
