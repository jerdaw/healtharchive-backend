# Mentions log (public-safe, link-only)

Purpose: a lightweight log of public mentions, links, or citations for HealthArchive.ca.

Hard rules:

- Do **not** add private contact details (emails, phone numbers, private notes).
- If permission to name is unclear, do **not** name the organization here.
  - Use `Pending` in the organization field until permission is explicit.

---

## Confirmed mentions (permission to name: Yes)

| Date (UTC) | Organization / Outlet | Link | Context |
|---|---|---|---|

## Unconfirmed mentions (permission: Pending / Unknown)

| Date (UTC) | Organization / Outlet | Link | Context | Permission status |
|---|---|---|---|---|

## Notes

- Keep descriptions factual and short.
- Prefer the most specific public link (the actual resources page that mentions HealthArchive).
