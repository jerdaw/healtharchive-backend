# Production baseline policy (desired state)

# This file is the canonical, versioned definition of what the production VPS
# should look like for HealthArchive. It is intentionally small and focused on
# invariants that matter for security, correctness, and operability.
#
# Paired tooling:
# - Observed snapshot generator: `scripts/baseline_snapshot.py`
# - Drift checker: `scripts/check_baseline_drift.py`
#
# The drift checker validates this policy against the real VPS configuration
# (without printing or persisting secrets).
