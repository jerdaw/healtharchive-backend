# HealthArchive ops roadmap (internal)

This file tracks the current ops roadmap/todo items only. Keep it short and current.

For historical roadmaps and upgrade context, see:

- `docs/planning/README.md` (backend repo)

Keep the two synced copies of this file aligned:

- Backend repo: `docs/operations/healtharchive-ops-roadmap.md`
- Optional local working copy (non-git): if you keep a separate ops checklist outside the repo, keep it in sync with this canonical file.

## Recurring ops (non-IRL, ongoing)

- **Quarterly:** run a restore test and record a public-safe log entry in `/srv/healtharchive/ops/restore-tests/`.
- **Quarterly:** add an adoption signals entry in `/srv/healtharchive/ops/adoption/` (links + aggregates only).
- **Quarterly:** confirm dataset release exists and passes checksum verification (`sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS`).
- **Quarterly:** confirm core timers are enabled and succeeding (recommended: on the VPS run `cd /opt/healtharchive-backend && ./scripts/verify_ops_automation.sh`; then spot-check `journalctl -u <service>`).
- **Quarterly:** docs drift skim: re-read the production runbook + incident response and fix any drift you notice (keep docs matching reality).

## Current ops tasks (implementation already exists; enable/verify)

- Maintenance window: complete the job lock-dir cutover by restarting services that read `/etc/healtharchive/backend.env`.
  - This must wait until crawls are idle unless you explicitly accept interrupting them.
  - Plan + commands: `../planning/2026-02-06-crawl-operability-locks-and-retry-controls.md` (Phase 4)
- Maintenance window (after 2026 annual crawl is idle): convert annual output dirs from direct `sshfs` mounts to bind mounts.
  - Why defer: unmount/re-mount of a live job output dir can interrupt in-progress crawls; benefit is reduced Errno 107 blast radius,
    but not worth forced interruption mid-campaign.
  - Detection (crawl-safe): `python3 /opt/healtharchive-backend/scripts/vps-annual-output-tiering.py --year 2026`
  - Repair (maintenance only): stop the worker and ensure crawl containers are stopped, then:
    - `sudo python3 /opt/healtharchive-backend/scripts/vps-annual-output-tiering.py --year 2026 --apply --repair-unexpected-mounts --allow-repair-running-jobs`
- After any reboot/rescue/maintenance where mounts may drift:
  - Verify Storage Box mount is active (`healtharchive-storagebox-sshfs.service`).
  - Re-apply annual output tiering for the active campaign year and confirm job output dirs are on Storage Box (see incident: `incidents/2026-02-04-annual-crawl-output-dirs-on-root-disk.md`).
- After deploying new crawl tuning defaults (or if an annual campaign was started before the change):
  - Reconcile already-created annual job configs so retries/restarts adopt the new per-source profiles:
    - Dry-run: `ha-backend reconcile-annual-tool-options --year <YEAR>`
    - Apply: `ha-backend reconcile-annual-tool-options --year <YEAR> --apply`
- Verify the new Docker resource limit environment variables are set appropriately on VPS if defaults need adjustment:
  - `HEALTHARCHIVE_DOCKER_MEMORY_LIMIT` (default: 4g)
  - `HEALTHARCHIVE_DOCKER_CPU_LIMIT` (default: 1.5)
- Verify the new alerts are firing correctly in Grafana:
  - `HealthArchiveCrawlRateSlowHC`
  - `HealthArchiveCrawlRateSlowPHAC`
  - `HealthArchiveCrawlRateSlowCIHR`
  - `HealthArchiveCrawlNewPhaseChurn`
  - `HealthArchiveInfraErrorsHigh`
  - `HealthArchiveCrawlMetricsStale`
