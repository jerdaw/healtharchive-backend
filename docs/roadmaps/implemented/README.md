Rules:

- Treat these as a record; avoid ongoing edits except for small errata.
- Use dated filenames: `YYYY-MM-DD-<short-slug>.md`.
- If a plan’s outcomes should be discoverable by future operators, ensure the relevant
  details are captured in canonical docs under:
  - `docs/deployment/`
  - `docs/operations/`
  - `docs/development/`
  and keep the plan here as supporting history.
