- **📚 Researchers**: Start with [Project Overview](project.md) → [Datasets](datasets-external/README.md)

## Key Resources

| Need | Documentation |
|------|---------------|

## Documentation Structure

This docs portal is built from the backend repo only. Frontend and datasets
docs are canonical in their repos and are linked-to from this site:

- Frontend pointers: `frontend-external/README.md`
- Datasets pointers: `datasets-external/README.md`
