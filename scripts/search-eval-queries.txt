# Golden queries used for search quality evaluation.
#
# We do not have query logs yet, so this list is intentionally eclectic:
# - Broad “hub intent” terms
# - Common refinements (testing, vaccines, isolation)
# - Named entities and specific medical terms
# - Non-COVID topics (to avoid overfitting)
# - A small French smoke-test set (bilingual content; no stemming)
#
# Keep it to realization-check size: ~25–50 queries so capture runs stay quick.
