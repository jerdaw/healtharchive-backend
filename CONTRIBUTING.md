## 📋 Development Workflow

### 1. Set Up Your Environment

```bash
# Fork and clone
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/healtharchive.git
cd healtharchive

# Create virtual environment and install dependencies
make venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Copy environment file
cp .env.example .env
source .env

# Run database migrations
alembic upgrade head

# Seed initial data
healtharchive seed-sources

# Verify setup
make ci
```

**See**: [Development Environment Setup](docs/development/dev-environment-setup.md) for details.

### 2. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
# Sync with upstream
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Create a descriptive branch
git checkout -b add-feature-name
```

**Branch naming conventions**:
- `add-*` - New features
- `fix-*` - Bug fixes
- `docs-*` - Documentation changes
- `refactor-*` - Code refactoring
- `test-*` - Test additions/fixes

### 3. Make Your Changes

**Follow these guidelines**:

- ✅ Write clear, focused commits
- ✅ Add tests for new functionality
- ✅ Update documentation as needed
- ✅ Follow existing code style
- ✅ Keep changes small and focused

### 4. Run Quality Checks

Before submitting, ensure all checks pass:

```bash
# Fast checks (required)
make ci

# Full checks (recommended)
make check-full

# Auto-fix formatting
make format
```

**What these do**:
- `make ci`: Format check, lint, typecheck, tests (~2 min)
- `make check-full`: Adds pre-commit, security scan, docs check (~5 min)
- `make format`: Auto-format code with ruff

### 5. Commit Your Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add user authentication

- Implement JWT token-based auth
- Add login and logout endpoints
- Include test coverage for auth flow

Closes #123"
```

**Commit message format**:
```
type: short description (50 chars or less)

- Longer explanation if needed
- Use bullet points for clarity
- Reference issues

Closes #issue-number
```

**Commit types**:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only
- `test`: Test additions/fixes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks
- `perf`: Performance improvements

### 6. Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
# Push to your fork
git push origin add-feature-name

# Open PR on GitHub
# Fill out the PR template completely
```

**PR Title Format**:
```
feat: Add user authentication system
fix: Resolve crawl timeout issue
docs: Update API consumer guide
```

---

## 📝 Code Standards

### Python Code Style

We use **ruff** for linting and formatting (configured in `pyproject.toml`):

```bash
# Check formatting
ruff format --check .

# Auto-format
ruff format .

# Check linting
ruff check .

# Auto-fix issues
ruff check --fix .
```

**Key style points**:
- Line length: 100 characters
- Use type hints on all functions
- Write docstrings for public functions
- Follow PEP 8 conventions

### Type Hints

All functions should have type hints:

```python
# ✅ Good
def process_snapshot(snapshot_id: int, include_metadata: bool = False) -> dict[str, Any]:
    """Process a snapshot and return metadata.

    Args:
        snapshot_id: The ID of the snapshot to process
        include_metadata: Whether to include full metadata

    Returns:
        Dictionary containing snapshot data

    Raises:
        ValueError: If snapshot_id is invalid
    """
    ...

# ❌ Bad
def process_snapshot(snapshot_id, include_metadata=False):
    ...
```

### Documentation

**Docstring format** (Google style):

```python
def search_snapshots(
    query: str,
    source: str | None = None,
    limit: int = 20
) -> list[Snapshot]:
    """Search for snapshots matching the query.

    This function searches the database for snapshots matching the provided
    query string, optionally filtered by source.

    Args:
        query: Search query string
        source: Optional source code filter (e.g., "hc", "phac")
        limit: Maximum number of results to return (default: 20)

    Returns:
        List of Snapshot objects matching the query

    Raises:
        ValueError: If limit is less than 1

    Example:
        >>> snapshots = search_snapshots("covid vaccines", source="hc", limit=10)
        >>> len(snapshots)
        10
    """
    ...
```

### Import Organization

Use ruff's isort integration (automatic):

```python
# 1. Standard library
import json
import logging
from datetime import datetime
from pathlib import Path

# 2. Third-party packages
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session

# 3. Local imports
from ha_backend.config import get_config
from ha_backend.models import ArchiveJob, Snapshot
```

---

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

### Writing Tests

All new code requires tests. We use **pytest**.

```python
# tests/test_feature.py
import pytest
from ha_backend.feature import process_data


def test_process_data_success():
    """Test successful data processing."""
    result = process_data({"key": "value"})
    assert result["processed"] is True
    assert result["key"] == "value"


def test_process_data_invalid_input():
    """Test error handling for invalid input."""
    with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="Invalid input"):
        process_data(None)


@pytest.fixture
def sample_snapshot(db_session):
    """Fixture providing a sample snapshot for tests."""
    snapshot = Snapshot(
        url="https://example.com",
        title="Test Page",
        capture_timestamp=datetime.now()
    )
    db_session.add(snapshot)
    db_session.commit()
    return snapshot


def test_with_fixture(sample_snapshot):
    """Test using a fixture."""
    assert sample_snapshot.title == "Test Page"
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific file
pytest tests/test_api.py

# Run specific test
pytest tests/test_api.py::test_health_endpoint

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=ha_backend --cov-report=html

# Run verbose
pytest -v

# Run with output
pytest -s
```

### Test Organization

- `tests/` - All test files
- `tests/conftest.py` - Shared fixtures
- `tests/test_*.py` - Test modules (mirror source structure)

**See**: [Testing Guidelines](docs/development/testing-guidelines.md) for more details.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Design

### Making Design Decisions

For significant architectural changes:

1. **Open a feature request** - Get feedback early
2. **Write a decision record** - Document the choice (see `docs/decisions/`)
3. **Create a roadmap** - For multi-step implementations (see `docs/planning/`)
4. **Get consensus** - Especially for breaking changes

### Decision Record Template

See `docs/_templates/decision-template.md` for the format.

**Example decisions**:
- Choosing a database migration tool
- Changing API authentication method
- Adding a new dependency

---

## 🔐 Security

### Reporting Security Issues

**DO NOT** open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

Instead:
1. Read the [security policy](https://github.com/jerdaw/healtharchive/security/policy)
2. Email `security@healtharchive.ca` with details and reproduction steps
3. Wait for acknowledgment before disclosing

### Security Best Practices

When contributing code:

- ✅ Never commit secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens)
- ✅ Use environment variables for configuration
- ✅ Validate all user input
- ✅ Use parameterized queries (prevent SQL injection)
- ✅ Escape HTML output (prevent XSS)
- ✅ Review dependencies for known vulnerabilities

We run security scans with:
- `bandit` for Python security issues
- `safety` for dependency vulnerabilities
